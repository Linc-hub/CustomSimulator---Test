"Here’s the Math Engine Internals flowchart — showing how CODEX should organize functions inside the simulator:

Inverse Kinematics (IK)

Arbitrary anchors, quaternion math, servo angle limits

Workspace Analysis

Sweep XYZ + RxRyRz, compute coverage, detect singularities

Torque & Dynamics

Map payload → leg forces, compute servo torque & RPM, joint stress

Optimization

Genetic algorithms, Pareto fronts, multi-objective tradeoffs

This provides CODEX with a modular blueprint: each box can be a self-contained module, but they all feed data into each other."






"Here’s a flowchart diagram showing how CODEX should structure the new simulator:

UI → Math Engine → Renderer → Export & Analysis

UI Layer → Sliders, inputs, JSON import/export

Math Engine → IK, workspace sweeps, torque/load modeling, optimization (GA/PSO/etc.)

Renderer → Canvas/WebGL visualization of anchors, rods, horns, workspace

Export & Analysis → JSON/CSV output, plots, optimization logs"




"Here’s the Dataflow Lifecycle diagram for CODEX — showing how a simulation run should work:

Input JSON Layout

Anchors, horn/rod lengths, servo ranges, payload

Inverse Kinematics (IK)

Compute servo angles, check joint/servo limits

Workspace Sweep

Explore XYZ + RxRyRz grid, build reachability map

Optimization Engine

Genetic algorithms / PSO / Monte Carlo tune geometry for coverage & torque

Export & Analysis

Output CSV/JSON results, plots, reports

This completes the full blueprint package:
